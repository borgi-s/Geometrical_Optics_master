# Geometrical_Optics-master

Welcome to the Geometrical Optics Code Repository! This repository serves as a snapshot of the powerful codebase used to generate the groundbreaking results presented in our recent article. If you're looking to understand, reproduce, or build upon the optical simulations that were an integral part of our research, you've come to the right place.

## Introduction
Optical phenomena play a vital role in a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, from physics and astronomy to telecommunications and medical imaging. This repository contains the Geometrical Optics code that powered the simulations and analyses discussed in our article, which is available [here](link-to-article).

Our codebase is designed to provide a clear and accessible implementation of Geometrical Optics principles, making it easy for researchers and enthusiasts to explore and experiment with optical systems. It can be used to simulate the behavior of x-rays as they interact with lenses, mirrors, prisms, and samples, helping you gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of your material.
